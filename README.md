I'm Bl@q Ciph3r (@vandeh827), a dedicated and curious professional with a deep-seated passion for <span style="color:#66ff00;">cybersecurity</span>. My journey is focused on the critical and dynamic field of <span style="color: #00bfff;">Security Operations Centers (SOC)</span>, where I aim to contribute to safeguarding digital infrastructures.

I believe in continuous learning and hands-on experience, which is why I'm currently immersing myself in the world of ethical hacking. I'm actively building my skills in <span style="color:#ff4500;">penetration testing</span>, <span style="color:#ff4500;">vulnerability analysis</span>, and <span style="color:#ff4500;">network defense</span> to better understand and counter emerging threats.

## My Interests

- **<span style="color:#00bfff;">Security Operations Center (SOC):</span>** The core of my interest lies in proactive threat detection, incident response, and security information and event management (SIEM). I'm fascinated by the challenge of staying one step ahead of adversaries.
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence:** I enjoy analyzing threat landscapes, researching new attack vectors, and understanding the motivations behind cyberattacks.
- **Ethical Hacking:** I'm committed to learning how to think like a hacker to better protect systems and organizations from real-world threats.
- **Automation & Scripting:** I'm always looking for ways to use Python, Bash and Powershell to automate security tasks and improve efficiency in the SOC.

## Collaborations

I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects. Whether it's a security tool, a learning resource, or a project related to SOC automation, I'm eager to contribute my skills and learn from others. If you have a project that could use a motivated and detail-oriented team member, please reach out!
